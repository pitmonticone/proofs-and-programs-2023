##### Getting started on a laptop/desktop

The easiest way to get started in Lean 4 is to download Visual Studio code and the Lean 4 extension. This is explained in the following video:

The video is part of a [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6-3eHsG5e4dRrUmRBr8vUSul6bmxiO0k) of videos on Lean 4.


##### Getting started without a laptop/desktop

In case you do not have an appropriate laptop/desktop, you have a few options:

* Use one of the cloud based services: Gitpod or Github Codespaces. The setup is explained in the [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6-3eHsG5e4dRrUmRBr8vUSul6bmxiO0k), except you should start with (your copy of) the course repository.
* Get an account on a machine in the mathematics department with vs-code server setup and connect from a browser. For this contact [Siddhartha Gadgil](https://math.iisc.ac.in/~gadgil).

##### Setting up a repository

You will need to set up a _private_ repository for the lab work [from the course repository](../private-repo/). In addition you will have to set up public repositories for your projects.
